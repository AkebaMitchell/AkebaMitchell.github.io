> This site is an avenue for me to share either data analysis techniques I find novel or interesting and/or ideas or thoughts from my background in healthcare and data science. Emerging methods in healthcare operations and health information systems often overlap with data science practices, as such, my posts may be directed at either one or both of these topics of interest.

<h3>THE BRIEF BIO</h3>

<br>

> I am a southern girl who is passionate about healthcare, programming, data science, social issues, and my community. I love conceptual thinking and am always working to diversify my perspectives by expanding my knowledge base and global reach. With this site, I hope to document what I learn and share what I know.

<br>

<h3>STILL CURIOUS? READ ON:</h3>

<br>

My Master’s degree is in Public Health (MPH). More specifically, Epidemiology with a specialized focus on data science and biostatistics. The MPH is designed for healthcare professions in many different fields from healthcare analysts, health consultants, data scientists, and many more.  The Epidemiology track taught me how to support my organization to gain strategic and tactical competitive advantages, which we can call knowledge management or business intelligence.

<br>

I hope to contribute posts on my site that align with my data interests with special focus on interdisciplinary relationships and data concepts and common practice. Data science is a fluid and dynamic field, its potential to create global change has yet to be realized. I believe that through syndemics, everything is connected. In that data plays a major role in shaping our society and world. The 21st century will be about exploring these connections and using data to make the best of them—it is my hope to be a part of this.

<p>I can't believe it's been more than a week since I returned from my trip to Chicago. This was an incredible opportunity and before I start this post a few thank yous are in order: I really can't thank [Uptake](www.uptake.com) enough for being the kind of company that does more than just 'have an mission statement'--having the motivation to start a philanthropic arm...</p>

<p>There _may_ be a special place in hell for blog posts like this that document how someone put together their static site website and hosted it on GitHub.  Especially when there is really great [documentation](rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) availible that has been put together by really smart people.  You can even look at Rmarkdown's website source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages) to see...</p>
